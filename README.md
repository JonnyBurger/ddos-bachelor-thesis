#Â Installation

You need `node` installed: https://nodejs.org/en/. At least v7.7, which is brand new, so make sure it's up to date (`node -v`).

In this folder, run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies. (You also have `npm` if you have `node`). That should be all.

## Run examples

Run the tests (which you can edit in the `test` folder):

```
npm test
```

## CLI

I'm building a CLI.

```sh
> node index.js estimate-gas BasicContract
> node index.js deploy-contract ReferenceContract
```

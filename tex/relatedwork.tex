There is a wide range of articles discussing DDoS mitigation. Osanaiya et al. \cite{DDoSOverview} show that the majority of proposed solutions need to be deployed on the access point and are not distributed.

DefCOM \cite{DefCOM} is a peer-to-peer framework for collaborative DDoS Defense that is being installed on multiple nodes in one network. The workload is distributed between the peers where each peer can have up to 3 tasks: Classifying, Rate Limiting and Alert Generation.

A proposal submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) \cite{IETFDraft} describes a peer-to-peer protocol for signaling source IP addresses of DDoS attacks which also works on a inter-organization level.

This thesis aims to further explore the idea laid out by the paper "A Blockchain-based Architecture for Collaborative DDoS Mitigation with Smart Contracts and SDN" \cite{OriginalPaper}.

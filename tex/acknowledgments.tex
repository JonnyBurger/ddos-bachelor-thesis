I would like to thank my supervisors, Thomas Bocek and Sina Rafati, for helping me find this topic and continuously guiding me during this work with ideas and knowledge and even helping me with formal language.

I would also like to thank the other members of the Communication Systems Group doing research on blockchains who have provided me with their input as well.

Finally, I would like to thank Prof. Burkhard Stiller for making it possible to write my bachelor thesis at the Communication Systems Group and for providing feedback as well.

\chapter{Installation Guidelines}

Using a UNIX terminal, navigate to the source code folder on the CD:

\texttt{cd code}

If no CD is available, the project can be cloned from the public Github repository (\texttt{git} required):

\texttt{git clone https://github.com/JonnyBurger/ddos-bachelor-thesis \&\& cd code}

If the  \texttt{node} command is not installed, install it from \url{https://nodejs.org}. The project has been tested with version 8.1.1 of node.js (\texttt{node -v} to see the version).

As the last step, the dependencies need to be installed:

\texttt{npm install}

The successful installation can be verified using:

\texttt{node index}

The above command also gives a help message to which commands can be used.
